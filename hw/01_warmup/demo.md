The links below link to `.jar` files. These are bundled Java programs. After
downloading, you should be able to double-click them to run. Depending on
your computer's settings, you may get security warnings running these.
These warnings are totally appropriate: you're downloading arbitrary programs
off the internet and running them! There's no reason for your computer to
believe that running these is safe. However, if you trust me and trust
your connection to the web server (a reasonable level of trust, especially
if you're on campus), then you should click past these security warnings
and run the demos.

(On a Mac, you may need to right-click the `.jar` file and choose `Open`
to even have the option of bypassing the security warning.)
