Assignment grading
------------------

All assignments are graded both for correctness and for style.

Correctness indicates how well the assignment meets its
specification -- that is, does it work? In correctness grading, I care more
about seeing your logic than about precisely what the program does when it
runs. For example, a program might have everything correct except for an
null pointer dereference early on. Such a
program will simply crash when run, but it is essentially correct. I might take
off just a bit of credit for the error, but you will earn the
rest of the credit for having an otherwise-correct program. The moral of this policy is this:
just because it doesn't work doesn't mean you've failed. Computers like to say
"right" and "wrong", but as a human, I can see the many points in between.

Style grading assesses how well you've conformed to the [Style
Guide](style.html), which dictates how you should write your code. Programming
is an act of communication both between you and a computer *and* between you and
another human. In some sense, correctness is about the former,
while style is about the latter.

Your grades will be given on a 5-point range, corresponding to Bryn Mawr's
4-point grading scale. Grades above a 4.0 are precisely equivalent to a grade
of 4.0, but allow me an opportunity to recognize exceptional work that exceeds
the expectations of the course.

Class Contributions
-------------------

This component of your grade is a reflection of how you have contributed to
this class. It includes participation, attendance, and engagement. I expect
every student to contribute to the class environment, both to improve your own
experience and to improve the experience of others. For example, you can be an
active partner when working in groups, you can post on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bmc-cs246/cs246/issues) or on our
[mailing list](mailto:cs246-sp17@lists.cs.brynmawr.edu), you can raise your hand
in class, and you can visit my [office hours](index.html) -- but there are
other ways to contribute, as well.

A fantastic way to contribute is to find ways to improve this material. Submit
a [pull request](https://github.com/bmc-cs246/cs246/pulls) against the `cs246` repo!

Exams
-----

This course has three exams: two midterms on Feb. 21 and Mar. 30, as well
as a self-scheduled final exam during the usual exams period.
Exams will be open-book and
open-note, but you will not be able to use a computer. Exams will *not*
cover interacting with the command line.

More details will be discussed as the exams approach.

Late policy
===========

Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date written on the
assignment. You will submit assignments via
[GitHub](http://github.com/) according to these [instructions](submitting.html).

Late assignments will lose 1 point (out of the 5-point scale) for every day
late (or portion thereof). Each student gets 3 free *late days* for the semester.
This means that the first three days (or portion thereof) that an assignment
is late will not lead to a penalty. These late days are intended to account for
unexpected bugs, minor illnesses, planned travel, etc. I will grant further
extensions only in rare circumstances.

Group work policy
=================

You are encouraged to work with others on assignments, **but your submission
must be your own**:

<div id="plagiarism">
All the code you submit must be written by you alone.
</div>

This means that, while it's a great idea to discuss general algorithms or
approaches with your classmates, **never share code**, and **never submit code
you found online**. Violators of this policy will be asked to report
themselves to the [Honor Board](http://sga.blogs.brynmawr.edu/honor-board/).

There is one exception to this rule: you may work with up to one partner on your
assignments, but you may use the same partner for no more than three assignments.
If you wish to work with a partner, you may add your partner to your GitHub
team, and they should get access to your repo. When you are working with a partner,
both students get the same grade; naturally, the code you write is jointly yours,
slightly overriding the boldface policies above.

If you have a question, post on [GitHub](https://github.com/bmc-cs246/cs246/issues).

GitHub
======

[GitHub](http://github.com/) is a code-collaboration website with extensive use in
the open-source and research communities. It is a tool you will be expected to be
familiar with whether you go on to industry or academia. Many recruiters use
GitHub to find students who are active coders. We will thus make
extensive use of this tool this semester, which will handle online question-and-answer forums,
student collaboration, hosting my materials, and more.

GitHub works with [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), a powerful version control
tool. Version control tools allow you to save your work incrementally. When
you then make a change you wish to revert, it is easy to go back in time.
`git` also eases collaboration with peers by allowing you to *merge* work
with others, working line-by-line to combine changes that multiple contributors
have made. `git` is pervasive both in academia in industry, along with
similar tools (such as Subversion and Mercurial).

Every student will need to have a GitHub account. These accounts are free.
Just click the "Sign up" button on the [main page](http://github.com).
I will ask you early on in the course to send my your GitHub username
so that you can get access to the course materials through the site.
I encourage you also to [register as a student](https://education.github.com/)
on GitHub; you get various services for free as a student.

While I encourage you to use your real contact details on the site (most people
do), this is by no means a requirement. Even if your normal GitHub account
has your real name, you are welcome to create an alternate, anonymous account if you
feel the need to post questions anonymously.

Accommodations for disability
=============================

Bryn Mawr College is committed to providing equal access to students with a
documented disability. Students needing academic accommodations for a
disability must first register with Access Services. Students can call
610-526-7516 to make an appointment with the Coordinator of Access Services,
Deb Alder, or [email her](mailto:dalder@brynmawr.edu) at `dalder@brynmawr.edu`
to begin this confidential process. Once registered, students should schedule
an appointment with me as early in the semester as possible to share the
verification form and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that
accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.
More information can be obtained at the [Access Services
website](http://www.brynmawr.edu/access_services/).

Email
=====

I use email heavily as a way of communicating with students and colleagues.
Accordingly, I expect all my students to check email daily at their college
email address. There may be important announcements / corrections / other
messages there. Please read them!

As an avid emailer, I also am happy to receive email from all of you. During
business hours, you can expect a response from me within a few hours of your
email -- often much sooner. After 5pm or so, I tend to take a break from
technology for several hours, either until 9pm or even until the next morning.
Do *not* expect me to respond to an email in the evening. Similarly, entire
weekends go by without my checking my email (the nicer the weather, the less
chance of a response!), and so it's possible that something
you send on a Friday evening won't reach me until Monday morning.

In an emergency, you may call me at home at 484-344-5924 or on my cell at
201-575-6474. No texts, please.

Another small point about email: I have two Bryn Mawr email addresses:
`rae@cs.brynmawr.edu` and `raeisenber@brynmawr.edu`. Both email addresses
go to the same place, though, and both work. You do not need to worry about
which one you send to.

Meetings
========

My office hours for Spring 2017 are Tuesdays 2:30-3:30 and Wednesdays 1:15-2:30.
This means that, at
these hours, I am guaranteed to be in my office and expecting visitors -- and
I really do want visitors. During class, it's hard to get to know all of you,
and I'd love to know more about what brought you into my class, what else
you're interested in (in computer science and more broadly), and how your
college experience is going generally. Come with a question, come to say hi,
or come to play one of my puzzles. You can even use your curiosity about my
puzzle collection as an excuse to get in the door.

If you have a conflict with my office hours, please email so we can find another
time to meet.

Beyond my office hours, I aim to have an open-door policy. If you see my
office door (Park 204) open, please interrupt me: that's why the door is
open!

For a broader discussion than just homework questions, I'd be happy to join
you for lunch in the dining hall. Just email or ask!
