NOTES FOR SPRING 2018:

- Use Robin for first project, not Owl. Robin just works better and removes
  unnecessary complication.

- Be much more specific about what features need to be in compound objects.
  List the methods, perhaps.

- Re-do feedback form to be more informative. The numbers just aren't all that
helpful. I want more text.
