first lab: include instructions for how to show all files, and show extensions. talk about folders & such.


CS topics to mention:
 - Algorithms (complexity theory, efficiency)
 - Theory (what *is* computable, after all?)
 - Programming languages (how to design PL, types)
 - Graphics (e.g., the pixels are all half a unit off, color spaces, efficiency, transformations)
 - machine learning (data processing, statistics)
 - AI (search, minimax)
 - networking

NOTES FOR SPRING 2018:

- Use Robin for first project, not Owl. Robin just works better and removes
  unnecessary complication.

- Be much more specific about what features need to be in compound objects.
  List the methods, perhaps.

- Re-do feedback form to be more informative. The numbers just aren't all that
helpful. I want more text.

- Make *requirements* in each homework assignment to clarify the process.
  Specifically check requirements in midterm project against rubric.

- Consider making the first exam online.

- Don't have projects due on the second meeting time of the week. Reason: it makes
  it very awkward to have lab time devoted to the project.

- Specify that lines of code with no effect will be penalized.

- Teach about constants and require them. This may force students to think about
  coordinates more on the midterm project.

- On midterm project, remind students that shapes within compound objects should
  be near (0, 0).

- Remember to update settings file to ignore resource leaks.

- Fix primes rubric to specifically mention the factors that are printed at the
  end. They must multiply to the original
