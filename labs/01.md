The bulk of this lab is in installing Eclipse and the ACM library, the
software we will use to program in Java all semester. This lab is *not*
typical of labs in this course. Most of the time, you'll be working with
a partner/group to solve problems. But before we can do that fun stuff,
we have to install the software.

1. Configure your computer to show file extensions:

   *  On a Mac: Make sure you're in the `Finder` app (e.g., click on your desktop).
      Go to the `Finder` menu and choose `Preferences...`. In the `Advanced` tab,
      choose to `Show all filename extensions`.

      If you also want to see hidden files (useful, but not strictly necessary,
      for the `.metadata` folder we'll be encountering soon):

      - macOS Sierra (v10.12): In any Finder window, press Cmd-Shift-.

      - Previous versions: See the "long way" instructions [here](https://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/). (It's not very long!)

   *  On Windows: [Read this](https://www.howtohaven.com/system/show-file-extensions-in-windows-explorer.shtml). These instructions also have you show hidden files/folders,
      which I have found more necessary on Windows than on Mac.

   *  On Linux: This just isn't necessary, because you have a more intelligent operating system.

2. Download [cs113.zip](lab01/cs113.zip) to a convenient spot where you wish to store your
   coursework. (Please, don't just put it on your desktop!)

3. Expand the .zip file.

   *  On a Mac: Double-click the `cs113.zip` file. A `cs113` folder should appear.

   *  On Windows:
