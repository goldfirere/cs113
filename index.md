Goals of course
---------------

<div id="goals">

By the end of this course, you will be able to...

* write standalone computer programs in the Java programming language
* design and write simple games and animations
* decompose a problem into its component parts
* explain the structure of the discipline of computer science

During the course, you will...

* code
* debug
* have fun
* work with other students every class

</div>

This is a first course in computer science. Though computer science encompasses
much more than just programming, many of the concepts of computer science are
best expressed in terms of computer programs. We thus begin our study of the
field by learning the basics of programming. This course is taught in the Java
programming language (*many* programming languages have been invented since
the dawn of computing), as it is both a frequently used beginner language
and has wide usage in industry. Furthermore, Java makes it easy to make
graphical applications, which can be fun for new students to create.

Programming is a *creative act*, where you get to introduce a new, interactive
artifact into the world. Programmers often talk of the *beauty* of an algorithm
or piece of computer code. Reading a computer program is not all that different
from reading a natural-language composition, and it is possible to critique
computer code for how well it communicates an idea and how well it is written.
In this course, we will aim to write *beautiful* code, not just functional code.

Course Philosophy
-----------------

In order to learn any programming skill, you must simply *do* it. Reading a book
or watching me code will not help you get better. This course is thus
*programming-intensive*. You will be expected to spend a significant amount of
time weekly (6-8 hours) outside of class programming to complete the homework
assignments. If you run into a snag, the programming burden may prove to be
even higher. Of course, programming is fun, so the time should fly by.

Much class time in CS113 will be spent working with peers to solve small
programming problems, conduct peer reviews, and complete other exercises.
There will also be lecture components where I demonstrate Java coding and
discuss the computer science concepts powering the programming.

Materials
=========

<div id="materials">

This course does not have a textbook. Instead, we will be using coding samples with
extensive comments, which serve essentially as lecture notes. We will be building
programs on top of the [ACM Java Toolkit](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/), which enables an easy start to
graphical programming.

Our programming will be done using [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/), a professionally-used
*integrated development environment* (IDE). This free software is powerful and can be
intimidating for new users. You will quickly get used to it, and we'll take some time
during labs to familiarize you with it. Instructions for setting up this software on your
machine will be distributed in the first lab.
