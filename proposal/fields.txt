Description:

This is an introduction to the discipline of computer science, suitable for
those students with a mature quantitative ability. This fast-paced course
covers the basics of computer programming, with an emphasis on program design
and problem decomposition. Graduates of this course will be able to write
small computer programs independently; examples include data processing for a
data-based science course, small games, or basic communications programs (such
as a chat client). No computer programming experience is necessary or
expected.

Prereq structure:

CMSC 110 is the current introduction to computer science. It is a corequisite
of CMSC 231 and a prerequisite of CMSC 206. The new course proposed here will
serve in exactly the same slot in our requirements structure, as a corequisite
of CMSC 231 and a prerequisite of CMSC 206. It is intended that the new course
is an expansion on CMSC 110, providing extra challenge to students capable of
the faster pace. The new course does not further change our prerequisite
structure.

Approach:

The data manipulation and visualization in this course fits the QM guidelines
closely. More broadly, successful programming requires much mathematical
reasoning.

Limiting enrollment:

This will be a very hands-on course, with a required lab component. Our lab
seats 24 students. The lottery will prefer younger students and students who
express an interest in majoring/minoring in computer science, just like CMSC
110's lottery.

Exams:

As a practice-based course, this course will culminate in a final project, not
a final exam. There will be several exams during the semester.
