The goal of this ungraded homework is to have the class come to a consensus on the
name of our pet owl:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/owl.png" width="148" height="142" />
</div>

(Perhaps some of you can draw a more convincing owl than I can. This one looks more like
a cat to me.)

To discuss, [make an account on Piazza](https://piazza.com/brynmawr/fall2017/cs113)
and start or join the conversation. Please use your College email address and
real name when
creating your Piazza account.

Please also fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/Ct69SNCnXQCV6GtB2) to get me to know you better.

Complete these tasks before class on Monday, September 11.
